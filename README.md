## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

You've been on the run all day. Relax! Take a seat. (quote from Hearthstone) Welcome traveler to my project. This is a slot machine project that I've created and as you can tell from the first line this is based off the game I love alot which is Hearthstone. Take a seat and start gambling!

## Lessons Learned:

Overall within this project I was learning more about the power of CSS and as well JavaScript. There was times where designing the page I felt that looking at it looked like a piece of cooked chicken without seasoning to be honest. So basically I did some research where I wanted my buttons to look better and have some sort of cool animation to it instead of a  button that you just click and go. My buttons took some time where I wanted them to look like they were ACTUALLY being pressed and as well added some shadow to  the slide itseld to make it look like it is floating from the page which is pretty cool. JavaScript portion was very difficult but yet pretty cool because since I'm new to the language.
