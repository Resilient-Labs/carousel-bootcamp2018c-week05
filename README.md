# What's in the Basket?
This project is a complete carousel which displays different fruit and vegetables in a basket. The user has the ability to click on 'back' and 'next' buttons to navigate the items.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using JavaScript I designed a simple navigation between an array of images. When the user clicks "next" the image source would be updated to the next image in the array. When the user clicks "back" the image source would be updated with the previous image in the array. It was necessary to consider edge cases such as when the user has reached the end of the array and clicks "next", or when they have reached the first index and click "back"

## Optimizations

One feature I would like to add to this project is the ability for users to delete or add new images into the carousel.

## Lessons Learned:

Looping through an array continuously!
